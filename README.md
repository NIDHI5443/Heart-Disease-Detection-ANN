# Heart Disease Predictor using Artificial Neural Networks 

## Overview
Artificial Neural Networks Model is created using various methods to predict whether a person would get Heart Disease or not.
Using features like age, sex, chest_pain, resting_blood_pressure, serum_cholestoral, fasting_blood_sugar, resting_ecg_results, max_heart_rate_achieved, exercise_induced_angina, oldpeak, slope of the peak, num_of_major_vessels, thal, heart_disease.

## Methods Used
* ANN was build from scratch using classes and functions.
* ANN was build using Sklearn.
* ANN was build using Keras of Tensorflow.

## Prerequisites
* Python 3 
* an IDE (preferably Jupyter Notebook)
* Pandas 
* Numpy 
* Matplotlib 
* Sklearn 
* Tensorflow

All the external dependencies can be installed by using ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
